## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
The client module initiates the data collection process, gathering information from the endpoint. This includes:
   - **System Information:** Details about the operating system, hardware, installed applications, running processes, and system configurations.
   - **Network Data:** Information on active network connections, traffic patterns, and any unusual or suspicious network activity.
   - **File Activity Logs:** Records of file creation, modification, deletion, and unauthorized access attempts that could indicate malicious activity.

### 2. Data Forwarding
The **Forwarder Mechanism** is responsible for securely transmitting the collected data to the server. It performs the following tasks:
   - **Data Encryption:** Encrypts data using advanced cryptographic standards to ensure confidentiality during transmission.
   - **Compression:** Reduces the size of the data to optimize bandwidth usage and improve transmission speed.
   - **Batching:** Groups smaller pieces of data into larger batches to minimize the frequency of transmissions and reduce network overhead.

### 3. Data Analysis
The **Analysis Engine** on the server processes the incoming data in several stages:
   - **Preprocessing:** Cleans and organizes the data to prepare it for analysis, removing any irrelevant or redundant information.
   - **Static Analysis:** Examines files and processes for known malware signatures, suspicious strings, or unusual attributes. This includes checking against known malware databases and using YARA rules.
   - **Dynamic Analysis:** Observes the behavior of files and processes in a controlled environment (sandboxing) to detect any malicious actions that may not be evident through static analysis.
   - **Anomaly Detection:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify deviations from normal behavior patterns that could indicate a potential threat.
   - **Rule-Based Detection:** Applies custom detection rules and signatures to identify known threats and emerging attack techniques.

### 4. Alert Generation
If malicious activity is detected, the system generates alerts containing detailed information, such as:
   - **Threat Type:** A classification of the detected threat (e.g., malware, intrusion, data exfiltration).
   - **Severity Level:** An assessment of the potential impact of the threat on the system or network.
   - **Recommended Actions:** Guidance on how to respond to the detected threat, such as isolating the affected endpoint or blocking a specific IP address.

### 5. Reporting and Response
After generating alerts, the system creates detailed reports that are accessible to the security team. These reports include:
   - **Incident Summary:** An overview of the detected threat, including its source, type, and potential impact.
   - **Detailed Analysis:** In-depth information on the threat, including the affected systems, files, and processes, as well as any observed behavior patterns.
   - **Response Actions:** Suggested or automated actions taken by the system to mitigate the threat, such as quarantining files, terminating malicious processes, or blocking network connections.

## Component Details
